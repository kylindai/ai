      "\n",
      "A very good effort with this tricky grape. Along with the stone-fruit flavors are sweeter streaks of cotton candy and marshmallow. But the candied fruit is lively and not cloying or artificial. The finish is long and clean, with a twist of buttered nuts and creamy vanilla.\n",
      "Predicted:  40.058777 Actual:  18.0 \n",

      "Complex and smooth wine, keeping firm tannins well integrated with the elegant polished fruit. With refreshing acidity to go with the fruit and tannins, the wine is finely, ripely balanced.\n",

      "Greenwood Ridge does a terrific job with Scherrer's Alexander Valley Zin grapes, capturing the intensity of these century vines while maintaining balance. The flavors are powerful, of wild summer red, blue and black berries, crushed pepper, Asian spices, crème de cassis, licorice and cola. Enjoy this potent wine now through 2014, before it loses its fruit.\n",
      "Predicted:  22.442596 Actual:  25.0 \n",

      "\n",
      "This is off dry, low alcohol (11.5%), spiced up with tart acidity and loaded with rich, ripe fruit flavors mixing pears and peaches. Sweet without being sugary, it should appeal to a wide spectrum of wine drinkers, and snap together the flavors of a Thai food. Columbia Crest makes 18,000 cases of this wine.\n",

      "Still tight, and expertly crafted and structured, this single-vineyard estate wine is meticulous in velvety, plush texture, completely seductive at every angle. Rich red cherry, pomegranate and vanilla improvise against one another without ever missing a beat, finishing in fully integrated flavor. Drink now through 2022.\n",

      "Even if this full-bodied Cab starts with some eggy, pastry-like aromas, it soon finds its form. The nose brings char and baked black fruit, while the palate is full of creamy blackberry and brown sugar flavors. Rather rich and ripe, with medium tannins and mild acidity. Drink sooner than later.\n",

      ". The winery's above-the-fog vineyard has been kind to Merlot, nearly always producing an interesting wine. The '05, from such a cool vintage, has given crisp, firm tannins, but long hangtime allowed the grapes to develop luscious blackberry flavors, which smoky oak perfectly accents. A wine of charm and depth; should develop bottle complexity over the next 6 years.\n",

      "Predicted:  13.230602 Actual:  11.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This has a powerful, briary character, with a spicy, high-alcohol kick. It erupts in the mouth, with flavors of wild berry, tobacco, cola, anise and white pepper that should pair well with equally spicy fare, preferably fatty meats and cheeses.\n",
      "Predicted:  29.76374 Actual:  27.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Voluminous yet silky, this undeniably complex offering from Te Kairanga features hints of smoky bacon, black tea and briary herbs surrounding a core of black cherries and plums. The fine texture stands out on the long, slightly warm finish.\n",
      "Predicted:  38.626263 Actual:  40.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Although this winery is better known for its Shiraz, I have been a consistent fan of its Riesling as well. The 2006 offers scents of powdered minerals and lime followed by flavors of apple and citrus. It's medium-bodied but muscular, with plenty of intensity that comes through on the long finish. Drink now–2016.\n",
      "Predicted:  18.204212 Actual:  21.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Richly textured, this Pinot comes from the Sebastopol area. In this cool vintage, it has a bright burst of acidity and is very dry, with intricate flavors of raspberries, cherries, pomegranates, licorice, sweet oak and lots of dusty spices. Now–2014.\n",

      "\n",
      "A soft, delicate nose of spice and mocha lead on this approachable Cab from South Africa. Simple flavors of berry and tobacco and an overall integrated character make it an easy choice for everyday sipping. Could use some structure and complexity but for the price, it's a good buy.\n",
      "Predicted:  2.499884 Actual:  10.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This bombastically brawny Merlot is blended with Syrah and Malbec. The grapes have been sourced from some fine vineyards, including Hudson, Stagecoach and Antica, as well as the cooler Trefethen in Oak Knoll. Juicy blackberry veers into syrupy territory, a thickness that never lets up, accented in smoky oak and vanilla.\n",
      "Predicted:  48.708183 Actual:  40.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Starts off with some forceful charred aromas and some rustic, unintegrated notes on the finish, but give this wine some time to settle down and it shines. Grilled peaches and roasted cashews mingle easily with mineral notes, and what the finish lacks in finesse at this stage it makes up in power. Better in 2008. Imported by Vintus LLC.\n",
      "Predicted:  83.05815 Actual:  85.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Leather, pencil shavings and cedar provide an edge to this wine. It's otherwise soft and approachable in a mix of blackberry and black cherry, a seasoning of cinnamon and clove providing a pleasant hit of spice on the finish.\n",
      "Predicted:  53.718727 Actual:  50.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, Errazuriz's progressive wines hit their marks. But this Chard seems to be substituting oak for substance. The bouquet comes straight from the barrel, and the palate is resiny as it houses lemony, baked apple flavors. Finishes as woody as it began. Too much oak, plain and simple.\n",
      "Predicted:  23.9848 Actual:  21.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Made in a wonderfully dry, crisp style, Sauvignon Blancs like this fill a much-needed niche in fruit-heavy California. It's zesty and minerally, with lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors. Beautiful as a cocktail sipper, or with the perfect roast chicken.\n",
      "Predicted:  19.86686 Actual:  13.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Dark and rubbery, with a heavyweight's presence. Nearly assaultive on the palate, with hard, acidic fruit that's jumpy and tight. A tough wine, no matter how many times you come back to it.\n",
      "Predicted:  12.161696 Actual:  15.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Dry, soft and simple, with pleasant flavors of grilled cherries, raspberries, cola, red licorice, red currants and smoky oak. The texture is nice and silky. Drink now.\n",
      "Predicted:  22.978477 Actual:  32.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Sweet on the nose yet firm as a bristle brush, with lime and pineapple as the key aromas. Feels juicy, tight and light on the tongue, with fine acidity propelling nectarine, lime and melon flavors. Zesty, crisp and pure throughout. A serious value among white wines.\n",
      "Predicted:  16.037664 Actual:  14.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "While it shares the same electricity and mineral finesse of Bürklin-Wolf's other 2014 Premier Cru (labeled P.C.) wines, the Rechbächel has an intensely fruity, almost tropical appeal. It's concentrated and ripe, but with cutting white grapefruit and tangerine acidity leading a long, focused finish. Drink now through 2025.\n",
      "Predicted:  101.93675 Actual:  38.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A beautiful Chardonnay, rich and ripe in fruit, yet balanced with dryness and racy acidity and a fine minerality. The pineapple and orange flavors are accented with sweet, smoky oak. Drink this luxuriously elegant wine now.\n",
      "Predicted:  30.916973 Actual:  30.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A stemmy, weedy wine with a chippy mouthfeel, edgy tannins and grating acidity. Balance and harmony are not in the cards here; the wine is a messy mix of buttery oak and burnt, stalky fruit. The finish is muddled and mills around with no place to go.\n",
      "Predicted:  23.428776 Actual:  20.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenere, Merlot and Barbera, this simple, bright red blend offers simple layers of cherry and blackberry, with background tones of black olive and cheese rind.\n",
      "Predicted:  26.648638 Actual:  26.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This 2009 shows the varietal's fantastic wealth of exotic tropical fruits, flowers, honey and spices. But it's also vibrant in acidity, with a core of cold minerality.\n",
      "Predicted:  18.928032 Actual:  16.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Est! Est!! Est!!! takes its name from an ancient legend in which a bishop desired some good wine on his travels to Rome. In Montefiascone, his servant found wine so good he wrote Est (“It is”) three times to alert his master. This blend of white grapes is light, informal and very welcoming.\n",
      "Predicted:  13.415373 Actual:  12.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "From this showplace estate close to Saint-Tropez, this attractive wine brings out a warm and sunny character. It is smooth with just a light tang of clementines that is balanced with the riper raspberry fruit. Drink now.\n",
      "Predicted:  16.551016 Actual:  22.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A sweet Chardonnay, made in the popular style. It's rich and creamy in vanilla and buttered toast, with fruity notes of pineapple and Key lime pie.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is Dutton Estate's unoaked Sauvignon Blanc. It did not go through the malolactic fermentation, but it started as very ripe grapes, so what you get is pure citrus, Asian pear, white peach and green apple flavor, zesty and clean in acidity, with slight a sweetness in the finish. Nice with Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese fare.\n",
      "Predicted:  19.145617 Actual:  20.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Toasty and relatively smooth, with a comfortable nose and body. Smoothness is this wine's prime attribute, while the flavors are your basic apple and citrus. Finishes with tang and zest, and overall the wine satisfies while not pressing too hard to do so.\n",
      "Predicted:  5.3807883 Actual:  11.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Very rich, dry and crisp in acidity, a Chardonnay that feels fine from your first sip through the spicy finish. Made with 35% new French oak, and aged eight months on the lees, it's drinking beautifully now, with pear, pineapple, vanilla custard and buttered toast flavors. Just lovely.\n",
